				<p>
					<b>Hand planting</b><br>
					A measuring tape is used to mark 25cm/40cm depending on maize variety along a measuring line for the distances between the seeds. A second measuring line is measured at a distance of 75cm/80cm/90cm between rows depending on maize variety. <br> 
					A planting stick is used to make two holes at the same time, one at a depth of 5cm for seed and the other at a depth of 10cm for an application of 10g of fertilizer. <br>
					Place the seed and make the final covering. Make sure that the seed is well holed in to ensure good contact with moisture. All seeds must be well covered.
				</p><br>
				<p>
					<b>Mechanical planting</b><br>
					This type of planting has the advantage of being quick, and if well supervised will give excellent results. However, if it is poorly supervised, it will give poor-to-disastrous results. It allows you to plant a large acreage within your pre-determined planting period. Adapt a spacing compatible with other mechanical operations like fertilizer application and weeding. Check the machine well before the anticipated planting date to make proper adjustment. Always read the operator's manual and seek advice from the suppliers for effective usage. Every season, make sure that the planter is calibrated to avoid making costly mistakes.
					<ul>
						<li>Below are some guidelines for calibration:</li>
						<li>Each planter must be tested separately.</li>
						<li>Select plates that will allow the largest seed of your seed sample to go through. Make sure the plate does not allow two seeds at a time.</li>
						<li>Make sure that the driving wheel drops seeds in the furrow opener.</li>
						<li>Count the number of seeds dropped by the planter over a measured length in the field at a set driving speed. The number can be multiplied to get total number dropped / ha. The correct operating speed is normally indicated in the operator's manual e.g. 5 km/h.</li>

				<p>
					Government intends to construct a 1, 000 metric tonne capacity warehouse in each district to provide handling and storage space for the surpluses which are anticipated. In order for the surpluses not to stay in the warehouses for long and to encourage the consumption of local food, the Ministry of Food and Agriculture will enter into agreements with the Ministries of Gender, Education and Health to purchase foodstuffs for the School Feeding Programme, for colleges, hospitals and other state institutions.

				<b><li>Type of government subsidy for maize in Northern region Ghana.</li></b>
				<p>
					For the compound fertilizer of 50kg/ha, out of the full cost of Gh¢115.00 government subsidy amounts to Gh¢26.00 thus pegging the selling price at Gh¢89.00, representing 26% in price reduction while for Urea, government subsidy on 50kg/ha costing Gh¢105.00 was Gh¢21.00, representing a 20% of subsidy. 
					<br><br>
					The market prices for both the compound fertilizer and the urea were Gh¢89.00 per 50kg bag and Gh¢84.00 per 50 kg bag, respectively. By these price reductions, it is estimated that government is subsidizing fertilizer at an average of 21%.
